# ziprubyapp - Create executable Ruby script bundles using ZIP archives

This program bundles several Ruby module files and wraps them into an
"executable" ZIP archive. An output file can be invoked as a Perl
script or (if the source file contains a `#!` line) as a directly
executable command. It can also be handled by almost any ZIP
archiver as a self-extracting ("sfx") archive.

Inside Ruby scripts, the built-in `require` facility is extended so
that the program can simply use `require` or `require_relative`
statements to load the contained modules without modifying the
`$LOAD_PATH` (`$:`) variable.

For detailed usage, see
[the manual page in Markdown format](man/ZIPrubyapp.1.md), or (if
installed via gem) the manual pages in man or HTML format (run `gem
contents ziprubyapp` to locate them).
